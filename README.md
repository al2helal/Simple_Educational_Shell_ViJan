# Simple_Educational_Shell_ViJan
I have written this shell in C when I was continuing an OS lab. I did this for assingment. After completing the lab course I also
give extra effort for adding extra features and removing bugs. There also many bugs and missing features yet.

Welcome to anybody who want to contribute.

Note: Don't copy this for assignment purpose.
